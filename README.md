SocialParty
===========
This project has two purposes:

1. To see if I can create an end-to-end project. Current choice for Backend is python,
even though I should consider easier platforms such as node, or no-backend systems such as FireBase.
2. To create a platform for planning a "social party", in which the guest list is connected to 
the list of items for the party.
